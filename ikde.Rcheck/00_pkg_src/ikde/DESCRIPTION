Title: Iterative Kernel Density Estimation
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Taylor", "McKenzie", email = "tkmckenzie@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimation of model marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model selection using iterative
    kernel density estimation. A multitude of methods exist for performing model selection in
    general and estimating marginal likelihood in specific, but none are partically well-suited to
    large models (such as Gaussian processes) applied to relatively limited datasets. Methods are
    provided to specific and construct Stan models, estimate those models, and estimate the
    marginal likelihood of those models.
